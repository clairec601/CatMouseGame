# Cat Attack
You are transported to the land of Tom and Jerry (and Donkey Kong?!). Play as 'Tom' and make your way up the platforms and ladder to reach your lovely mouse girlfriend. Be careful of 'Jerry' and the toxic yarn balls he throws in your way!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Get to your girlfriend at the top and avoid the balls of yarn!
* Movement: arrow keys ('right', 'left')
     * Jump: 'space'
     * Climb ladder: 'up'

## Setup
Made with Unity Editor Version 2022.3.16f1

## Learning Journey
* This game requires a bit of patience and clever maneuvering. Enhances your concentration and focus!
* New Technologies:
    * Unity: This code sample is from my days in AP CS A, submitted as a final group project, and was my second project working in Unity. I handled the coding aspect of this project, and learned more about GameObject movement, preserving data with static variables, how to spawn objects, and managing scene changes. It was particularly difficult, especially because we weren't explicitly taught how to use Unity, and learned mostly through online tutorials and research.
